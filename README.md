# Football-Score-Counter

this is my first android app.
this app does not include all score counting methods that are there in the real word because i am beginner in this field of making th e android apps. also this project is originally given by "Udacity Android basics nano-degree" which i am pursuing.

## it inclued the following functionalizes:

-> you can track the score of two teams at a time

-> "reset" button reset all the faul and score to zero

-> there are three button to count of score and one button for count foul
